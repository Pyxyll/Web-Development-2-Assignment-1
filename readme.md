#To Do#

1. Ask a minimum of five questions (maximum of 10) . The quiz should
randomly display the questions to the users.
a. Use prompt boxes to ask the user each question. Check each answer given
by the user to ensure they have given you an answer (i.e. they have left answer
box blank etc..) and then check answer given against the correct answer.
2. Keep track of the number of questions the user answered correctly
3. Provide a final message after the quiz letting the user know the number of
questions he or
she got right.
i.e. Congratulations Joe , You got 5 out 5 questions Correct
4. Rank the player. If the player answered all five correctly, give that player the
gold crown:
if they answered between 3-4 questions correctly they get a silver crown; 1-2
correctanswers is a bronze crown and 0 correct is no crown at all.
Your JavaScript should be written in an external js file called quiz.js. Insert the
relevant JavaScript into this file in order to run the quiz
